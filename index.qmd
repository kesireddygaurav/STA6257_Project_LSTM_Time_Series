## Introduction

Recurrent networks can in principle use their feedback connections to
store representations of recent input events in form of activation's
("short-term memory", as opposed to "long-term memory embodied by slowly
changing weights). The most widely used algorithms for learning what to
put in short-term memory, however, take too much time or do not work
well at all, especially when minimal time lags between inputs and
corresponding teacher signals are long. With
conventional"Back-Propagation Through Time" or "Real-Time Recurrent
Learning", error signals "flowing backwards in time" tend to either (1)
blow up or (2) vanish: the temporal evolution of the back-propagated
error exponentially depends on the size of the weights. Case (1) may
lead to oscillating weights, while in case (2) learning to bridge long
time lags takes a prohibitive amount of time, or does not work at all.
Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM), a novel recurrent network architecture in
conjunction with an appropriate gradient based learning algorithm comes
up as a remedy to solve this problem. It can learn to bridge time
intervals in excess of 1000 steps even in case of noisy, in-compressible
input sequences, without loss of short term time lag capabilities. This
is achieved by an efficient, gradient-based algorithm for an
architecture enforcing constant error flow through internal states of
special units[@hochreiter1997long]. Recurrent neural networks with Long
Short-term Memory have emerged as an effective and scalable model for
several learning problems related to sequential data. The central idea
behind the LSTM architecture is a memory cell which can maintain its
state over time, and non-linear gating units which regulate the
information flow into and out of the cell. Most modern studies
incorporate many improvements that have been made to the LSTM
architecture since its original formulation.However, LSTM's are now
applied to many learning problems which differ significantly in scale
and nature from the problems that these improvements were initially
tested on[@greff2016lstm].

A large part of real-world datasets are temporal in nature. Due to its
distinctive properties, there are numerous unsolved problems with wide
range of applications. Data collected over regular intervals of time is
called time-series (TS) data and each data point is equally spaced over
time. TS prediction is the method of forecasting upcoming
trends/patterns of the given historical dataset with temporal features.
A time series (TS) data can be break downed into trend, seasonality and
error. A trend in TS can be observed when a certain pattern repeats on
regular intervals of time due to external factors. In many real world
scenarios, either of trend or seasonality are absent. After finding the
nature of TS, various forecasting methods have to be applied on given
TS. Given the TS, it is broadly classified into 2 categories i.e.
stationary and non-stationary. A series is said to be stationary, if it
does not depend on the time components like trend, seasonality effects.
Mean and variances of such series are constant with respect to time.
Stationary TS is easier to analyze and results skillful forecasting. A
TS data is said to non-stationary if it has trend, seasonality effects
in it and changes with respect to time. Statistical properties like
mean, variance, sand standard deviation also changes with respect to
time[@chimmula2020time].

## Methods

A vanilla LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate
and a forget gate. This forget gate was not initially a part of the LSTM
network, but was proposed later by [@gers2001lstm] to allow the network
to reset its state. The cell remembers values over arbitrary time
intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information
associated with the cell[@greff2016lstm].

**Figure 1** Architecture of a typical vanilla LSTM
block[@van2020review].

The LSTM architecture consists of a set of recurrently connected
sub-networks, known as memory blocks. The idea behind the memory block
is to maintain its state over time and regulate the information flow
thought non-linear gating units. The Fig. 1 displays the architecture of
a vanilla LSTM block, which involves the gates, the input signal
$x^{(t)}$, the output $y^{(t)}$, the activation functions and the
peephole connections. The output of the block is recurrently connected
back to the block input and all of the gates.

We can describe how the LSTM model works in details by assuming a
network comprising N processing blocks and M inputs. The forward pass is
this recurrent neural system is described in 6 parts.

**Block input**. This step involves updating the block input component
which combines the current input $x^{(t)}$ and the output of that LSTM
unit $y^{(t-1)}$ in the last iteration. This can be done as shown below:

$$z^{(t)} = g(W_zx^{(t)} + R_zy^{(t-1)} + b_z)    -     (1) $$

where $W_z$ and $R_z$ are the weights associated with $x^{(t)}$ and
$y^{(t-1)}$ respectively while $b_z$ stands for the bias weight vector.

**Input gate**. During this step, we update the input gate that combines
the current input $x^{(t)}$, the output of that LSTM unit $y^{(t-1)}$
and the cell value $c^{(t-1)}$ in the last iteration. This can be done
as shown below:

$$i_{(t)} =\sigma(W_ix^{(t)} + R_iy^{(t-1)} + p_i.c^{(t-1)} + b_i ) -(2) $$
where '**.**' denotes point-wise multiplication of two vectors $W_i,R_i$
and $p_i$ are the weights associated with $x^{(t)}$,$y^{(t-1)}$ and
$c^{(t-1)}$ respectively while $b_i$ represents for the bias vector
associated with this component.

In previous steps, the LSTM layer determines which information should be
retained in the network's cell states $c^{(t)}$. This included the
selection of the candidate values $z^{(t)}$ that could potentially be
added to the cell states, and the activation values $i^{(t)}$ of the
input gates.

**Forget gate**. During this step, the LSTM unit determines which
information should be removed from its previous cell states $c^{(t-1)}$.
Therefore, the activation values $f^{(t)}$ of the forget gates at the
time step *t* are calculated based on the current input $x^{(t)}$, the
outputs $y^{(t-1)}$ and the state $c^{(t-1)}$ of the memory cells at the
previous time step (t-1), the peephole connections, and the bias terms
$b_f$ of the forget gates. This can be done as shown below:

$$  f_{(t)} = \sigma(W_fx^{(t)} + R_fy^{(t-1)} + p_f.c^{(t-1)} + b_f ) -(3)     $$
where $W_f,R_f$ and $p_f$ are the weights associated with
$x^{(t)}$,$y^{(t-1)}$ and $c^{(t-1)}$ respectively while $b_f$ denotes
the bias weight vector.

**Cell**. This step computes the cell values, which combines the block
input $z^{(t)}$, the input gate $i^{(t)}$ and the forget gate $f_{(t)}$
with the previous cell value. This can be done as shown below:

$$  c^{(t)} = z^{(t)}. i^{(t)} + c^{(t-1)}.f^{(t)}-(4) $$

**Output gate**. This step calculates the output gate, which combines
the current input $x^{(t)}$, the output of that LSTM unit $y^{(t-1)}$
and the cell value $c^{(t-1)}$ in the last iteration. This can be done
as shown below:

$$  o^{(t)} = \sigma(W_ox^{(t)} + R_oy^{(t-1)} + p_o.c^{(t-1)} + b_o ) -(5) $$
where $W_o, R_o$ and $p_o$ are the weights associated with
$x^{(t)}$,$y^{(t-1)}$ and $c^{(t-1)}$ respectively, while $b_o$ denoted
for the bias weight vector.

**Block output**. Finally, we calculate the block output, which combines
the current cell value $c^{(t)}$ with the current output gate value as
follows:

$$ y^{(t)} = g(c^{(t)}). o^{(t)}-(6) $$ In the above steps, $\sigma$, g
and h denote point-wise non-linear activation functions. The logistic
sigmoid $\sigma(x) = 1/(1+e^{1-x})$ is used as a gate activation
function, while the hyperbolic tangent $g(x)= h(x)= tanh(x)$ is often
used as the block input and output activation function[@van2020review].

## Analysis and Results

**About Dataset** This dataset provides data from **1st January 2013**
to **24th April 2017** in the city of Delhi, India. The 1 parameter here
under consideration is **meantemp**

### Data and Visualization

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # importing, cleaning, visualising 
# library(tidytext) # working with text
library(keras) # deep learning with keras
library(ggplot2)
mean_temp <- read.csv("DailyDelhiMeanTemp.csv")


```

First five observations of the dataset are

```{r}
mean_temp %>% head()
```

The time series plot of the dataset is given below with **date** on
x-axis and **meantemp** on y-axis respectively.

```{r}
mean_temp$date <- as.Date(mean_temp$date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")

mean_temp$meantemp <- as.numeric(mean_temp$meantemp)


ggplot(mean_temp, aes(x = date, y = meantemp)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Mean Temperature") +
  ggtitle("Mean Temperature Over Time") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
Split dataset into train and test sets

```{r}
mean_temp$order=seq(1, length(mean_temp$date))

# Perform min-max transformation on 'meantemp' column and store in a new column 'transformed'
mean_temp$transformed <- (mean_temp$meantemp - min(mean_temp$meantemp)) / (max(mean_temp$meantemp) - min(mean_temp$meantemp))

```


Generally in LSTM the data needs to be in a supervised learning mode.
That is done by having at least 2 variable: target variable *Y* and
predictor *X*. To achieve this, we transform the series by lagging the
series and have the value at *time (tâˆ’k)* as the input and value at
*time t* as the output, for a k-step lagged dataset.
